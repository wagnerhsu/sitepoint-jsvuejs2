# Jump Start Vue.js - Chapter 8 Demo

This example builds upon everything covered in the book. It uses the concepts learned to create a Nuxt.js app with a Vuex store and authentication that fetches data from a remote API and displays it in a custom component, linking to a detail page for each item.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
