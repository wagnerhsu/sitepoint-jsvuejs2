    <p>This example builds upon everything we've covered in the book. It uses
    what we've learned to create a Nuxt.js app with a Vuex store and authentication,
    that fetches data from a remote API and displays it in a custom component,
    linking to a detail page for each item.</p>
    <p>Go to the <nuxt-link to="/users">Users page</nuxt-link>.</p>
